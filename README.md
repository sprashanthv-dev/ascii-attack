# CSCI 5448 Object Oriented Analysis and Design - Semester Project

### **Project Title**: Ascii Attack
### **Team Members**:
 - Prashanth Vamanan Srinivasan
 - Ashwin Viswamithiran
 
### **Recorded Video Demo**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kBFFURuHwAwYeDx1tQn8qSFHVL096sOy/view?usp=sharing

### **Project Summary**:
ASCII Attack is a blend of the gaming classics - Arkanoid and Space Invaders, testing the player’s reflexes and attentiveness. Letter and Number blocks fall from random positions and the player tries to clear them by pressing the corresponding letter or number on the keyboard. The game ends when the player misses “x” number of blocks as per the level before the player’s health expires or when the player clears all levels successfully. Once the game ends, the total points accumulated is displayed along
with a leaderboard showing the highest scores accomplished so far.

### **Tools and Technologies Used**:
 - Language - Python (v3.10.4)
 - Libraries - Pygame (v2.3.0)

### **Other Instructions**:
 - To execute the program, clone this repository.


 - On your local machine, open the cloned directory and double click on the **main.py** file to launch the game.
  
 - Make sure python3 is available and the latest version of pygame (2.3.0) library is installed as a dependency on your local machine for the game to function properly.
  
 - Alternatively, the cloned directory can also be  opened in a text editor such as VSCode or PyCharm and the editor's built-in run functionality can be used to launch the game.  

 - Note that the player's score will be recorded in the game only when the following conditions are met:

      - The name should be entered and enter key must be pressed.
      - The current score obtained should come in the list of top ten scores obtained in the game so far.


- If the name is entered and enter key is not pressed, the score will **not be** recorded.
  
- To verify whether the score has been recorded correctly in the leaderboard:
  
    - Navigate to assets -> text_files -> highscores.json file (or)
    - Launch the game and from the welcome screen click on view leaderboard button.
  
 - Back button is not functioning and hence when navigating either to view leaderboard or view rules screen, the game has to be closed using the close icon on the toolbar and launched again.
